# The-Face-Regonition-Project

A simple face recognition script built in python 3.7 that identifies and classifies all faces in an image. 
It recognize and manipulate faces from Python or from the command line with the world's simplest face recognition library.
It is built using dlib's state-of-the-art face recognition built with deep learning. The model has an accuracy of 92.38% on the Labeled Faces in the wild benchmark. This also provides a simple face_recognition command line tool that lets you do face recognition on a folder of images from the command line.

### HAPPY CODING! :computer:

# Requirements
* cmake : https://pypi.org/project/cmake/
* dlib : http://dlib.net/
* face_recognition : https://pypi.org/project/face_recognition/
* numpy : https://www.numpy.org/
* opencv-python : https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/

# How To Run

* Install all of the packages listed in requirements.txt.
* Place an image inside of the root direcotry called "test.png". This will be the file that faces will be identified in.
* Place all of the faces that you wish to identify inside the folder "faces", rename them to be "face name".jpg. This folder contains all of the known faces and will be how the program recognizes people.
* Finallly run the "face_recog.py" script.
