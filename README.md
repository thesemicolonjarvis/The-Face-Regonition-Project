# The-Face-Regonition-Project

A simple face recognition script built in python 3.7 that identifies and classifies all faces in an image. 
It recognize and manipulate faces from Python or from the command line with the world's simplest face recognition library.
It is built using dlib's state-of-the-art face recognition built with deep learning. The model has an accuracy of 92.38% on the Labeled Faces in the wild benchmark. This also provides a simple face_recognition command line tool that lets you do face recognition on a folder of images from the command line.
